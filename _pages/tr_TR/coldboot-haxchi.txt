### Required Reading

CBHC (Coldboot Haxchi) changes your default system title from the system menu to your DS virtual console game. This causes your device to launch CFW automatically at boot.

This exploit is slightly more dangerous than standard Haxchi because your DS Virtual Console game exploit is the *only* way to boot the system. If this game is ever deleted or the exploit is removed, installing CBHC will BRICK your device!

{% capture notice-1 %}
You MUST have a functional Haxchi setup for this to work. If you do not, you will BRICK!

Your Haxchi DS virtual console game MUST be on the internal memory of your Wii U. If it is on a USB drive, you will BRICK!

Your Haxchi DS virtual console game MUST be a LEGITIMATE (non-pirated) copy or you will BRICK!

### Instructions

#### Section I - NAND Backup

{% capture notice-1 %}
This is an optional section which will create a backup of your device's internal NAND memory on your SD card, which will allow you to restore your device in the case of a brick.

If you have a black Wii U (32GB) model, your SD card must be at least 64GB in size. If you have a white (8GB) Wii U model, your SD card must be at least 16GB in size.
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
It is not possible to brick your device by installing CBHC as long as *all instructions and warnings are followed*. This, combined with the strict SD card requirements and extremely slow NAND dumping speed, means that creating a NAND backup is currently an optional step

If you accept the risk of installing CBHC without a NAND backup, skip this section.
