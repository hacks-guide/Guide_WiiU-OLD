title: "Homebrew Launcher"
---

The Homebrew Launcher is a homebrew application that lists and allows the launching of other homebrew applications from the SD card.
{: .notice}

We launch this using the Wii U's built in browser, so your Wii U will need to be able to access the internet.
{: .notice--info}

#### Instructions

1. Launch the browser on your device
1. Go to the browser settings and select "Reset Save Data"
  + This will prevent issues with the browser exploit
  + This will also delete all save data including settings, history, and bookmarks
1. Return to the browser

### For 5.5.0 & 5.5.1

1. Go to `http://loadiine.ovh`
  + You may want to bookmark this address to save time on typing in the future
1. Ensure that the drop down box shows "Homebrew Launcher 1.4 (5.5.0 - 5.5.1)", then press "Submit"
  + This may take many tries
  + In some situations, the "Homebrew Launcher 1.3 (5.3.2 - 5.4.0 - 5.5.0 - 5.5.1)" option may be more reliable for launching the Homebrew Launcher
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. Your console should load the Homebrew Launcher

### For 5.5.2

The method of entering the Homebrew Launcher is extremely unstable and unreliable, at the time being. Please get a Haxchi-compatible game before following this, so you can enter the Homebrew Launcher with an almost 100% guaranteed success rate. Using Mocha CFW is highly not recommended, since the broswer exploit required to enter the Homebrew Launcher and run Mocha, is unreliable.

2. Go to `http://u.drg.li/`
  + You may want to bookmark this address to save time on typing in the future
3. Click "2"
  + This may take many tries
  + In some situations, the other options/numbers are more reliable.
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
4. Your console should load the Homebrew Launcher
