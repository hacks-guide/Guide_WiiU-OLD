### Required Reading

These steps will prepare your SD card for installing Coldboot Haxchi custom firmware.

Before beginning, you should make sure your Wii U is currently on firmware 5.5.0, 5.5.1 or 5.5.2. Older versions aren't currently supported.

Your SD card is recommended to be at least 16GB or 32GB to have enough space for dumping and installing games. If you want to make a backup of your Wii U's system in case it needs to be restored in the future, you will need an SD card at least twice the size of your Wii U's system memory (16GB SD card for an 8GB white console; 64GB SD card for a 32GB black console).

Your SD card must be formatted as FAT32 (Allocation Unit Size of 32K (32768)). Most SD cards will be formatted this way by default.

If you need to format an SD card on Windows, do not use the built in formatter or it may cause issues. Use [guiformat](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) instead and set to an Allocation Unit Size of 32K (32768).

Your SD card *cannot* be named `wiiu`, or it will cause problems.

Before starting, you may want to check your SD card for errors using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac))!

#### Section II - DS Virtual Console Game

There are two methods for using Wii U custom firmware.

The first method is to run a browser exploit through the browser which will patch the system. Unfortunately, the nature of this exploit is that this *must* be run after every reboot.

The second method is to purchase a very cheap exploitable DS Virtual Console game to launch your Custom Firmware automatically at boot.

The DS Virtual Console game *must* be a **legitimately purchased** copy of the game installed to the **internal memory** of your device. You *cannot* install this DS Virtual Console game to a USB drive.

If you want to use the DS Virtual Console method, you should purchase the game before proceeding to the next section.
