<a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest system version, is my device hackable?*    
**A:** Yes

<a name="faq_oldfw" />**Q:** *I have a Wii U on X.X.X firmware. What can / should  I do with it?*    
**A:** This guide is only compatible with versions 5.5.0 to 5.5.2. Older versions are incompatible for now.

<a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Now that Nintendo is ending production of the Wii U, does that mean no more updates?*    
**A:** No! The version 5.5.2 has been released well after the end of production. That's why you must always ensure that you have set DNS servers that will block updates.

<a name="faq_updatesysnand" />**Q:** *Is it safe to update patched SysNAND?*    
**A:** No! You must always ensure that you have set DNS servers that will block updates.

<a name="faq_updatemocha" />**Q:** *How do I update to the latest Mocha CFW?*    
**A:** Download the latest release of [Mocha CFW](https://github.com/dimok789/mocha/releases/latest), then copy `mocha.elf` from the Mocha CFW `.zip` to the `/wiiu/apps/mocha/` folder on your SD card (overwrite the existing file)

<a name="faq_risky" />**Q:** *How risky is hacking my console?*    
**A:** Bricks are extremely rare and usually caused by skipping instructions or otherwise not following instructions.

<a name="faq_homebrew" />**Q:** *Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this?*    
**A:** Yes! This not only enables the Homebrew Launcher, but it also will give you hacks on all versions, which means you keep it forever, even with updates.

<a name="faq_regionfree" />**Q:** *Can I use this to play games from other regions?*    
**A:** Mocha CFW supports Region Free patches, which enables users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps.

<a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Is it safe to update patched SysNAND?*    
**A:** No! You must always ensure that your internet settings include DNS servers that block updates just in case a new update is released!

<a name="faq_support" />**Q:** *Where should I go for support?*    
**A:** For support, ask for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).

<a name="faq_sdsize" />**Q:** *How big of an SD card do I need?*    
**A:** Your SD card must be at least 64GB in size if you have a black Wii U (32GB) model. If you have a white (8GB) Wii U model, your SD card needs to be at least 16GB in size.

<a name="faq_NNID" />**Q:** *Can I keep my NNID?*    
**A:** If you start with an NNID and follow every step, you will end up keeping your NNID at the end.

<a name="faq_nopc" />**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)?*    
**A:** All you need is the ability to put files on an SD card!
