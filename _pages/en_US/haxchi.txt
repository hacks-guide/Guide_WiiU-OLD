Haxchi is a custom firmware that patches signature checks, region checks, and runs other custom code in the background.
{: .notice}

Haxchi is an exploit that allows us to launch CFW directly from the system menu without using the Homebrew Launcher.
{: .notice--info}

## For 5.5.0 & 5.5.1 ONLY

If on Wii U version 5.5.0 or 5.5.1 and you need to purchase one of the exploitable games, run NNU-Patcher from the Homebrew Launcher then launch the eShop. Once it has been purchased, re-enter the [Homebrew Launcher](homebrew-launcher).
