title: "NAND Backup"

### Required Reading

This section will create a backup of your device's internal NAND memory on your SD card, which will allow you to restore your device via a hardmod in the case of a brick.

### Instructions

{% capture notice-1 %}
A backup of the MLC partition is optional as it's huge in size, and most bricks that need MLC to be restored are done by user-error.

If you want a full backup including MLC, and have a black Wii U (32GB) model, your SD card must be at least 64GB in size. If you have a white (8GB) Wii U model, your SD card must be at least 16GB in size.
