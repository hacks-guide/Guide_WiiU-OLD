Mocha CFW is a custom firmware that patches signature checks and boots RedNAND.
{: .notice}

RedNAND is short for "**Red**irected **NAND**". This is a copy of your Wii U's internal memory stored in a partition of the SD card which is used instead of the main system memory. RedNAND is completely independent of the physical memory chip in your Wii U, meaning that your device will still work even if you brick the RedNAND by installing something you should not have.

In order to boot the patch signature checks and boot RedNAND, you will need to enter the Homebrew Launcher and run Mocha CFW every time your device reboots.

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Configuring Mocha CFW

1. Remove your SD card from your Wii U while it is on the Homebrew Launcher
2. Put your SD card from your Wii U into your computer
3. **Backup every file on your SD card to a folder on your computer; all files on it will be deleted later**
4. Reinsert your SD card into your Wii U
5. Launch Mocha CFW
6. The Mocha CFW configuration menu should load
7. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to set the following:
  + Config view mode: **expert**
  + Skip the menu on launch: **on**
  + Show launch image: **on**
  + Don't relaunch OS: **off**
  + Launch System Menu: **on**
  + redNAND: **on**  
  + SEEPROM redirection: **on**
  + OTP redirection: **on**
  + Use syshax.xml (coldboothax): **off**
8. Press (A) to confirm and exit
9. Your Wii U should display a black screen; this is the RedNAND setup
10. Press the power button **on the console** (not the gamepad) to start copying your internal system memory to your SD card
  + Be prepared to wait; this can take a while (up to several hours depending on how much used space you have on the internal memory)
11. Once this process is completed, your Wii U will end up on a black screen
  + This is normal; the SD card has been formatted
12. Put your SD card from your Wii U into your computer
  + Your SD card will have significantly less space on it now because the RedNAND is occupying a hidden partition on it
13. Copy all of the files you backed up back to your SD card
14. Reinsert your SD card into your Wii U
17. Power on your Wii U

##### Section II - Launching Mocha CFW

1. Create a folder on the first page of your home menu named "SysNAND"
2. Go to the System Settings, then internet, then press (X) to display your current network connections
3. For each of your connections (and all future connections), do the following
  + Select "Change Settings"
  + Set the DNS to "Don't Auto-Obtain"
  + Set the DNS server IPs to the following servers
    + `168.235.092.108`
    + `081.004.127.020`
  + Select "Confirm", then press (B) to save
  + These servers will block your SysNAND from being updated
4. Return to the home menu
5. Launch the Homebrew Launcher using the browser
6. Launch Mocha CFW
7. If the exploit was successful, you will launch Mocha CFW with RedNAND
  + If you no longer see the SysNAND folder once the home menu loads, you have successfully booted RedNAND

___

You will need to launch Mocha CFW from the Homebrew Launcher every time you reboot in order to enter RedNAND
{: .notice}

As long as you do not see the SysNAND folder in the home menu, you can be sure you are in RedNAND.
{: .notice--info}

If you wish to use vWii, you must access it from SysNAND. All vWii functions will be unusable on RedNAND.
