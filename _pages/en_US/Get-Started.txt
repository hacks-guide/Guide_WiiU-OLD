These steps will prepare your SD card in preparation for installing coldboothax custom firmware.
{: .notice--primary}

Before beginning, you should update your Wii U to the latest version to ensure compatibility. This is currently 5.5.1.
{: .notice--info}

Your SD card must be at least 64gb in size if you have a black Wii U (32gb) model. If you have a white (8gb) Wii U model, your SD card needs to be at least 16gb in size.
{: .notice--info}

Your SD card must be formatted as FAT32 (64kb clusters if possible, otherwise 32kb clusters will do). Most SD cards will be formatted this way by default.
{: .notice--info}

If you need to format an SD card on Windows, do not use the built in formatter or it may cause issues. Use [`guiformat`](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) instead and set to an Allocation Unit Size of 32kb.
{: .notice--warning}

Your SD card **cannot** be named `wiiu`, or it will cause problems.
{: .notice--warning}

Before starting, you may want to check your SD card for errors using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac))!
