## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editors or backup software, and emulators for various older systems.

Running homebrew on your console is 100% free using nothing but the system's browser.

## What is Custom Firmware?

**Custom Firmware** ("CFW") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do, in addition to anything homebrew can do.

CFW can be easily set up on any console in any region on the latest version.

## What does this guide install?

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Wii U from stock
firmware to Coldboot Haxchi powered Mocha Custom Firmware. It utilizes homebrew as a stepping off point, but Custom Firmware is still the goal.

## What can I do with Custom Firmware?

+ Play all game discs and eShop games, regardless of region
+ Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games
+ Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators.
+ Install homebrew titles to your system, and have them appear on your Wii U Menu
+ Dump your discs to a format you can install, and play them without needing the disc
+ Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Wii U hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.**
+ This guide will work on all Wii U devices in all regions on the latest version.
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved).
+ The process of creating a RedNAND can take up to **multiple** hours for devices with a lot of used internal storage
+ Your SD card should be [MBR, not GPT](http://www.howtogeek.com/245610/) (the SD card that comes with the device will be MBR by default).
+ If you need to format a brand new SD card, you can use [`guiformat`](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) and set  an Allocation Unit Size of 32K.
