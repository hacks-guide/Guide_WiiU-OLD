External hard drives must be connected to the upper back USB port of the Wii U to be detected by vWii. This cannot be the same external hard drive you use for Wii U games. If you are using an external HDD that does not have its own power source, then you will need a [Y-cable](http://amzn.to/2mjQjin).
